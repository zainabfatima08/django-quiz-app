      Hi, Iâ€™m the creator of this Django Quiz App.  
      This platform is built to help learners test their skills in Python, Django, and web development.  
      My mission is to make learning fun and interactive. 
    </p>
    
    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->

    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
      Iâ€™m passionate about technology and education, and I believe in the power of interactive learning.  
      With this app, I aim to create a space where learners can sharpen their knowledge of web development and programming,  
      while having fun at the same time.     As a web developer, Iâ€™ve worked with various technologies and have always been fascinated by how the internet connects us.  
      Through this platform, I hope to inspire others to pursue careers in tech and grow their skills. ðŸ’»ðŸŽ®
